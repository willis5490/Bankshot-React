                                The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. 
                                It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A Death! 
                                What’s that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die 
                                first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked 
                                out when you’re too young, you get a gold watch, you go to work. You work forty 
                                years until you’re young enough to enjoy your retirement. You do drugs, alcohol, 
                                you party, you get ready for high school. You go to grade school, you become a kid, 
                                you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into 
                                the womb, you spend your last nine months floating …and you finish off as an orgasm.

                            The details of my life are quite inconsequential.  My father was a relentlessly self-improving 
                            boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother 
                            was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, 
                            he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he 
                            would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and 
                            the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd 
                            make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty 
                            standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian 
                            named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's 
                            breathtaking, I suggest you try it.
